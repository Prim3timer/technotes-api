to create the backend: 

step one: npm init -y

npm i express

npm i nodemon -D (the D makes it a dev dependency)

You can give the name property of the package.json anything you 
like. However it's goo pracitce to leave as the name of the backend folder.
in this case 'backend'.

In the script object of the package.json, remove the 'test' property and replace 
with 'start' and give it a value of 'node server'

Add another property called 'dev' and give it value of 'nodemon server'

next you create a .gitignore file in the root folder  of the backend project.

we now create the server file.
